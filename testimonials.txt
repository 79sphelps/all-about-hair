Ana is very sweet, polite, and personable. She listened to/understood exactly how I wanted my hair cut. This will be my go-to salon from now on.

New salon in a convenient location next to the Sunnyside Health clinic with plenty of parking and tons of eateries.  Affordable prices for a quick men's cut and/or color.

I love everything about Salon Fuss....The salon is brand new with amazing handmade, artisan, rustic wood features throughout. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. The staff is super helpful if you are new to Aveda product line. I never have a problem getting an appointment when I need it and the front desk staff are wonderful.
