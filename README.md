# all-about-hair
This is an older project from 2018. It does not implement any type of Redux pattern with NgRX/RxJS.

It includes APIs for authorized CRUD operations, authentication and access management with automatic JWT renewal (via OAuth), and simple/complex forms with custom validation. It includes client-side unit tests (WIP) and server-side unit tests mocked using the nock library. Integrates Google Calendar APIs.
